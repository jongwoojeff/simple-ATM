# simple-ATM

This is a simple ATM controller implemented in C++ using Xcode 11.2.1.

You can clone this project from: https://github.com/jongwoojeff/simple-ATM.git

## Build

For Mac users, this program can be opened in any Xcode versions that are compatible with 11.2.1.

For non-Mac users, you will need a C++ compiler that is compatible to GNU++14 and C++11 support. 

## Running the tests

This project includes 11 test cases that were implemented using Catch v2.4.1. Details about Catch can be found [here](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

Compiling the four C++ files given in [ATM_controller](https://github.com/jongwoojeff/simple-ATM/tree/main/ATM_controller/ATM_controller) will automatically run the test cases written in [ATM_Test.cpp](https://github.com/jongwoojeff/simple-ATM/blob/main/ATM_controller/ATM_controller/ATM_Test.cpp) and display the results on the terminal. 

Any additional test cases can be added to [ATM_Test.cpp](https://github.com/jongwoojeff/simple-ATM/blob/main/ATM_controller/ATM_controller/ATM_Test.cpp)
